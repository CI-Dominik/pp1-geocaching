                        Do you ever get stuck on a problem for hours and wonder why you even started? 
                        Problems like these can easily be fixed by just stepping outside.<br>
                        Walks, short or long, are great for your mental health and some studies even show 
                        that taking a walk on a regular basis can help with depressions. Combine all of 
                        that with a fun little game and you have the perfect cure for your brain.<br>
                        So take a step outside and become a better version of you!

                        Not only your mental state will thank you for fighting your laziness but also your body.
                        With only 30 minutes of walking, you can increase your overall fitness level and do 
                        something good for your heart as well.<br>
                        Search for a geocaching route and plan ahead which ones you want to target. This way,
                        you increase your geocache counter and your life expectancy at the same time.

                        Be honest for a second. And I mean really honest. How well do you know your town?<br>
                        Sure, you can point someone to the next bakery or grocery store, but with geocaching
                        you will get a whole new view on your surroundings. Ofen you will find new areas
                        in towns you know and do not know so far. You can even meet people that are taking
                        the same route as you at the same time and make some friends along the way.<br>
                        But always stick to geocaching rule #1: leave every place in the same condition you
                        found it in!

                <h2>What is geocaching?</h2>
                <p>
                    Geocaching is a virtual treasure hunt. But, of course you would like to get some more bits
                    of information.<br>There are several sites you can register on and get a virtual map on
                    which all of the area's geocaches are shown. You can filter the map for different types
                    of geocaches.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The one you will find most of the time is called a <strong>traditional geocache</strong>.
                    To get those, you need to actively visit the place that is shown on the map. There are
                    different sizes of caches, ranging from micro to large. What it looks like, is totally up
                    to the owner of the geocache.<br>
                    Other types are <strong>mystery caches</strong> for which you need to solve a virtual puzzle first to get
                    the cache's coordinates, <strong>lab caches</strong> that need you to answer questions and many more.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once you find a geocache, you need to open it, insert your name in the notebook or any
                    other way that is intented and log your find in the geocaching app of your choice.

                <h2>Am I too old for geocaching?</h2>
                <p>
                    There is no such thing as too old for geocaching. It is the perfect hobby for people who
                    want to take a walk, visit exiting new places and sometimes learn bits of town history.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even people with disabilities are able to join the fun activity. Every geocache has a
                    rating for its difficulty and terrain. You can easily filter out caches that only have a
                    low terrain rating. Almost every cache that qualifies is marked as suitable for people 
                    in a wheelchair.

                <h2>What you need</h2>
                <p>
                    In contrast to many other hobbies, geocaching requires only a minimal amount of tech.
                    A smartphone, something almost everybody has nowadays, is suitable to join the club of
                    geocachers. <br>If you do not want to rely on such a device, you can also download geocaching
                    data and transfer them to some gps trackers. No need for an internet connection while
                    navigating!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From here on, everything else is easily accessible. You only need a pen to enter your name
                    in the cache's log.<br>
                    Of course, there are also geocaches (with mostly a terrain rating of 4 or higher) that
                    require special equipment. For those, sometimes climbing or scuba gear is required.
                    Those geocaches are only recommended for professionals who know what they do.<br>
                    <strong>Never</strong> risk your health!
